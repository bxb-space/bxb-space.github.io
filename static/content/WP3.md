### Tying CMB polarization studies to the astrophysics of Galactic foregrounds

The quest for primordial B-modes brings together two important lines of research, the astrophysics of Galactic
foregrounds and the mathematics of component separation, which historically have been addressed
separately and by disjoint research teams.


Within BxB, we propose a unique contribution to the search for B-mode polarization where we will establish
the required interface between component separation and Galactic astrophysics. We will use our astrophysical
modelling to investigate the dependence of the polarization signal predictions on different foreground simulations,
their robustness with respect to the model uncertainties and their impact on CMB analysis.


We will capitalize on
the project results to develop a method that optimizes component separation. We will implement and validate it
within the BxB project using data from forthcoming CMB ground-based experiments that will be available to us.
