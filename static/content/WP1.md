### 3D mapping of the ordered magnetic field in the Solar neighborhood

Our perspective on the interstellar medium is moving from sky images to a 3D view. This revolution is driven by the advent of large-scale
stellar surveys and the Gaia space mission. Within BxB, we have the ambition to extend this breakthrough
to the Galactic Magnetic Field (GMF) in the Solar neighborhood.


Our first and most immediate step to achieve this will be to combine
stellar parallaxes with stellar polarization data to constrain the orientation of the ordered GMF within the Local
Bubble. To extend this work further out from the Sun, we will make use of the local correlation between interstellar
matter and magnetic field observed with Planck and LOFAR data.
This is a novel approach to the analysis of magnetized ISM observations, which we will pioneer.


Within BxB, we will develop a model of the ordered GMF from the Sun to the Galactic halo including the distortion of the
magnetic field associated with the Local Bubble. Success in this work will represent a major step forward in the
interpretation of Galactic polarization data.
