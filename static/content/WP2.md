### Statistical description of the turbulent magnetized interstellar medium

The richness of Planck and LOFAR observations calls for a breakthrough in our ability to analyze the data. To
make progress, we need to capture the hierarchy of coherent, anisotropic structures characterizing the structure of
the magnetized ISM and their interplay with the gas and dust microphysics, primarily in our project the polarization
properties of dust grains. This information is encoded in the data, but most of it is lost when one resorts to the
classical tools (i.e. one- and two-point statistics).


Within BxB, we will develop a novel approach to analyze observations of the magnetized ISM to statistically characterize
the multi-scale, non-Gaussian, coherent structures of both interstellar matter and the interstellar magnetic field,
including their correlation. The method developed on the data will also be used to analyze outputs from numerical
simulations and inter-compare results.


The data analysis will allow us to build stationary stochastic models of the turbulent magnetized ISM including
its highly intermittent components. These models will be used for two applications. First, the
models obatined analyzing data and magneto-hydrodynamic simulations will be compared to make headway towards a statistical characterization of interstellar turbulence of genetal significanec for astrophsyics. Second, we will use the model
to generate equivalent random fields and thereby simulate maps of polarized foregrounds to assess component separation in the analysis of CMB data.
