## Proposal  

> The BxB project addresses outstanding questions central to two rapidly advancing fields of astrophysics and cosmology : cosmic magnetistm through observations of Galactic magnetic fields and the Big-Bang through the observation of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB).  
>
> This research is funded by the French national science foundation (Agence National de la Recherche, ANR).  

#### Cosmic magnetism

The universe is magnetized.
Observations provide evidence for magnetic fields over a huge range of scales from planets to stars, galaxies and galaxy custers.  of Magnetism is of fundamental importance to astrophysics, because magnetic fields
are simulataneously an actor, a tracer and an outcome of cosmic evolution.

Magnetism is still a poorly understood facet of our universe but this is rapidly changing thanks to new observatories
that give us access to magnetic fields in the Milky Way. A diverse set of observations depend on Galactic magnetic fields (GMFs). However, each of them probes only certain features of GMFs, e.g., only the strength or the direction/orientation, or only one component parallel or perpendicular to the line-of-sight. In addition, observations are sensitive to magnetic fields in a specific medium, such as cold clouds, diffuse ionized gas, or the non-thermal synchrotron-emitting plasma. This means that there is no ideal tracer of GMFs and that all relevant tracers should be included to obtain a complete picture.


#### Big-Bang cosmology

CMB observations have contributed to transform
cosmology into a high-precision science. Today, the detection of the primordial
B-mode polarization of the CMB is the foremost challenge. The pattern and amplitude of this signal on large-scales reflect
the conditions that initiated the Big Bang, and thus directly constrain the physics on energy scales
many orders of magnitude higher than those accessible to the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). This signal, however,
is buried under the polarized foreground emission from our Galaxy, which has to be modelled and removed
with unprecedented precision to allow investigation of the early Universe.

With Planck data, the study of interstellar magnetic fields has become inter-connected to a paramount objective of observational cosmology : the quest for curl-like B-mode polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) expected to arise from primordial gravitational waves produced during the inflation era in the very early Universe.

The need to achieve an accurate removal of foreground contributions and quote reliable uncertainties
binds the search for primordial B-modes to the astrophysics of the dusty magnetized ISM.

#### Project goals

BxB has ambitious goals that involve inter-disciplinary collaborations.
Its success will rest on the BxB team ability to meet three main challenges.

- Combine the 3D density mapping of the ISM derived from stellar surveys including Gaia astrometry, with polarization data and theoretical models to build a 3D model of the ordered GMF from the Sun to the Galactic halo.

- The richness of Planck and LOFAR observations calls for a breakthrough in our ability to analyze data and numerical simulations, for comparison. We need to capture the hierarchy of coherent, anisotropic structures characterizing the structure of the magnetized ISM and their interplay with the gas and dust
microphysics, primarily in our project the polarization properties of dust grains. This information is encoded in the data, but most of it is lost when one resorts
to the classical tools (i.e. one- and two-point statistics), which have so far been used.

- Uncertainties arising from Galactic foreground residuals and their potential interplay with instrumental systematics will become the dominant term in the error budget of future CMB polarization experiments.  All component separation methods rely on simulated data to quantify uncertainties and potential biases. To reach the detection limit of primordial B-modes targeted by upcoming ground-based CMB experiments, the separation between Galactic and CMB polarization has to be performed with an outstanding accuracy facing the complexity of Galactic foreground.
