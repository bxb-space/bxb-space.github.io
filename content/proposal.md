Magnetism represents a fascinating, and so far **poorly understood**, facet of our cosmic origins.
Inthe past few years, cosmic magnetism has become a recognized and **rapidly growing field** of research in astrophysics.
This evolution was made possible by major improvements in observational capabilities.

The Planck satellite provided the **first all­sky map** of the polarized thermal dust emission,
which encodes information on the orientation of the Galactic magnetic field in dusty regions.
Radio telescopes, especially the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) in Europe, are opening a new
perspective by offering **unprecedented sensitivity and angular resolution** to image the
Galactic synchrotron emission; observations over a range of frequencies yield 3D data cubes
in which distinct magnetic structures along the line of sight are separated through Faraday tomography.

With Planck data, the study of interstellar magnetic fields has become inter­connected to a paramount
objective of observational cosmology: **the quest for curl­like B­mode polarization of the cosmic microwave
background (CMB)** expected to arise from primordial gravitational waves produced during the inflation era
in the very early Universe. The need to achieve an accurate removal of foreground contributions and quote
reliable uncertainties binds **the search for primordial B­modes** to the astrophysics of the dusty magnetized ISM.

BxB has ambitious goals that involve **inter­disciplinary collaborations**.
Its success will rest on the BxB team ability to meet three main challenges :

- (1) Combine the 3D density mapping of the ISM derived from stellar surveys including Gaia astrometry,
with polarization data and theoretical models to **build a 3D model of the ordered GMF** from the Sun to the Galactic halo.
- (2) The richness of Planck and LOFAR observations calls for a breakthrough in our ability to analyze data and numerical
simulations, for comparison. We need to capture the hierarchy of **coherent, anisotropic structures** characterizing the structure
of the magnetized ISM and their **interplay with the gas and dust microphysics**, primarily in our project the polarization properties of dust grains.
This information is encoded in the data, but most of it is lost when one resorts to the classical tools (i.e. one­ and two­point statistics),
which have so far been used.      
- (3) **Uncertainties arising from Galactic foreground residuals and their potential interplay with instrumental systematics** will become the dominant term in the error budget of future CMB polarization experiments.

All component separation methods rely on simulated data to quantify uncertainties
and potential biases.

To reach the detection limit of primordial B­modes targeted by upcoming ground­based CMB experiments,
the separation between Galactic and CMB polarization has to be performed with **an outstanding accuracy
facing the complexity of Galactic foreground**.
