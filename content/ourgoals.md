BxB has __three salient goals__ that involve that involve inter­disciplinary collaborations.
Combining observations (of dust polarization, synchrotron emission and Faraday rotation),
statistical data analysis and modeling,
numerical simulations and theory,
we will:

- (1) Build the **first 3D model of the ordered magnetic field** from the Sun to the Galactic halo
- (2) Achieve a **statistical description** of the turbulent component of the interstellar magnetic field
- (3) Provide a **physically motivated model** of the multi­phase high latitude foregrounds needed to optimize separation of CMB and Galactic polarization, and reliably **quantify uncertainties in the search for primordial gravitational waves**.
